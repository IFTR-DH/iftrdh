##Mission Statement

The Digital Humanities in Theatre Research Working Group applies Digital or Enhanced Humanities to theatre and performance studies research. Digital Humanities revolutionizes scholarship by making unprecedented amounts of data readily available for study. For example, our members are building virtual theaters, cataloguing knowledge of theater history, and creating new kinds of archives. We focus primarily on issues relevant to digitally based research projects. Initially we have four goals fundamental to the field:

-   To generate new knowledge in theatre and performance studies through the innovative use of digital tools in our research.
-   To disseminate and collect information on the growing number of digital humanities projects in theatre and performance research so that solutions to problems relating to pedagogy and technology can be jointly addressed, expertise can be shared, and collaborations can be developed.
-   To apply the critical tools of theater and performance studies to emerging methodologies and discourses in the digital humanities.
-   To create the technology that will allow for sharing data across projects and to set standards for digitally encoding theater history in order to reduce the amount of duplicated data entry effort now taking place.
-   To preserve cyber based theatre and performance research projects for future generations by ensuring their inclusion in open source libraries and other platforms.

A secondary focus will be the examination of best practices in using the digital humanities in the teaching of theatre and performance studies.
